# QLoRA Finetuning with IPEX-LLM

We provide [Alpaca-QLoRA example](./alpaca-qlora/), which ports [Alpaca-LoRA](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/tree/main) to IPEX-LLM (using [QLoRA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) algorithm) on [Intel GPU](../../README.md).

Meanwhile, we also provide a [simple example](./simple-example/) to help you get started with QLoRA Finetuning using IPEX-LLM, and [TRL example](./trl-example/) to help you get started with QLoRA Finetuning using IPEX-LLM and TRL library.
